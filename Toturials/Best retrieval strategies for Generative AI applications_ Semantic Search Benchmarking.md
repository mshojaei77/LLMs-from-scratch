## Introduction to Semantic Search

Welcome to the AI Show, where we explore cutting-edge advancements in artificial intelligence! In this episode, we discuss semantic search benchmarking with an expert in Azure Cognitive Search, Liam Cavanagh. Stay tuned as we unravel the intricacies of retrieval-augmented generation, hybrid search strategies, and the revolutionary impacts of semantic search technologies.

## Understanding Different Search Options

### Keyword Search

Keyword search is the traditional approach where search engines look for exact matches of the query words in the documents. This method handles variations like "run," "runner," and "running," which has been the backbone of search engines for a long time.

### Vector Search

Vector search represents words, phrases, and text sections as numerical vectors in multidimensional space. This method goes beyond mere keyword matching by understanding the contextual similarity between queries and documents, such as recognizing "Zurich" and "Switzerland" as related terms.

### Hybrid Search

Hybrid search combines the strengths of keyword and vector searches to provide more robust and relevant results. It performs both searches simultaneously and merges the results to leverage the best of both worlds.

## Semantic Search and Its Applications

Semantic search takes it a step further by adding a second tier of ranking. After initial search results are obtained (typically through hybrid search), semantic search re-ranks these results based on advanced machine learning models. This process further refines the search outcome, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of results.

### Example: Understanding Retrieval Modes

To grasp these concepts better, let's delve into practical examples.

## Practical Demonstration

### Traditional Keyword Search

Imagine searching for specific information within human resource documents. If the query is a straightforward keyword such as an email address, traditional keyword search performs exceptionally well.

### Vector Search Example

When the query involves more abstract terms like "underwater activities," vector search excels by understanding the contextual relevance of words like "scuba" and "lessons," which might not be as effective with classic keyword search.

### Hybrid Search Example

Combining both keyword and vector searches, hybrid search aims to deliver the best possible results. Even though certain queries might not yield top results with either method alone, hybrid search balances the strengths of both.

## Harnessing the Power of Semantic Search

Adding a semantic layer to this hybrid approach enhances the search experience significantly. By re-ranking the results based on deeper analysis of intent, semantic search can bring the most pertinent information right to the top, providing a finer and more accurate result set.
