# Understanding HyDE: Hypothetical Document Embeddings in Dense Retrieval

**By [Sam Witteveen](https://twitter.com/Sam_Witteveen)**

In this comprehensive blog post, we explore the concept of HyDE, or Hypothetical Document Embeddings, and its practical application in dense retrieval systems, which are central to modern information retrieval. This technique originates from the paper "Precise Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval Without Relevance Labels" and provides a powerful way to improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. 

Let's dive deep into HyDE, starting from its basics to practical implementation.

## Introduction to Dense Retrieval and HyDE

Dense retrieval involves looking up data using similarity search, often querying a vector store. It uses embeddings to find semantically similar items. HyDE introduces a novel twist to this processâ€”by generating hypothetical answers using a large language model (LLM) before performing the similarity search.

```plaintext
Dense retrieval is a method for fetching information based on the semantic similarity of content rather than just keyword matching.
```

## The Paper and Its Significance

The concept of HyDE came from the paper "Precise Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval Without Relevance Labels", published towards the end of last year. This paper has not garnered the attention it deserves. Despite its simplicity, the technique presents a significant enhancement for RAG systems, making them more robust and efficient.

## Understanding HyDE Through an Example

To understand HyDE better, let's take an example involving McDonald's. Consider the query: "What are McDonald's best-selling items?" Even though the query doesn't mention food items explicitly, the user is implicitly asking about burgers, fries, etc.

In traditional dense retrieval, finding the right answer can be challenging without these explicit mentions. HyDE addresses this by having an LLM generate a hypothetical answer that includes relevant terms, enhancing the embedding-based retrieval process.

1. Input Query: "What are McDonald's best-selling items?"
2. Hypothetical Answer by LLM: "McDonald's best-selling items include burgers, Big Mac, fries, and shakes."
3. Embedding the Hypothetical Answer
4. Retrieving Similar Documents Using the Embedding

This approach shifts the retrieval from query-to-answer similarity to a more effective answer-to-answer similarity.

## Practical Implementation of HyDE

### Required Libraries and Setup

To implement HyDE, we need several components, including LLMs for generating answers and embedding models for creating vector representations.

```python
# Required Libraries
import openai
from langchain import LangChain
from some_embedding_library import BGEEmbeddings # Replace with actual library

# Initialize OpenAI and Embedding Models
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'
embedding_model = BGEEmbeddings(api_key='your-embedding-model-api-key')
```

### Generating Hypothetical Answers

We can use a large language model (LLM) to generate hypothetical answers based on our input query.

```python
# Function to Generate Hypothetical Answer
def generate_hypothetical_answer(query, custom_prompt=None):
    if custom_prompt:
        prompt = custom_prompt
    else:
        prompt = f"Please write a passage to answer the question: {query}"
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="davinci",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example Usage
query = "What are McDonald's best-selling items?"
hypothetical_answer = generate_hypothetical_answer(query)
print(hypothetical_answer)
```

### Embedding and Retrieval

Once we have the hypothetical answer, we generate its embedding and use it to retrieve documents.

```python
# Generate Embedding for Hypothetical Answer
embedding = embedding_model.embed_text(hypothetical_answer)

# Use the Embedding to Retrieve Similar Documents
# This part assumes you have a function to query your vector store
retrieved_docs = vector_store.query(embedding)
```

### Complete Example Script

```python
import openai
from langchain import LangChain
from some_embedding_library import BGEEmbeddings # Replace with actual library
from vector_store_library import VectorStore # Replace with actual vector store library

# Initialization
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'
embedding_model = BGEEmbeddings(api_key='your-embedding-model-api-key')
vector_store = VectorStore(api_key='your-vector-store-api-key')

# Function to Generate Hypothetical Answer
def generate_hypothetical_answer(query, custom_prompt=None):
    if custom_prompt:
        prompt = custom_prompt
    else:
        prompt = f"Please write a passage to answer the question: {query}"
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="davinci",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example Usage
query = "What are McDonald's best-selling items?"
hypothetical_answer = generate_hypothetical_answer(query)

# Generate Embedding for Hypothetical Answer
embedding = embedding_model.embed_text(hypothetical_answer)

# Use the Embedding to Retrieve Similar Documents
retrieved_docs = vector_store.query(embedding)

# Output Retrieved Documents
for doc in retrieved_docs:
    print(doc)
```

## Considerations and Best Practices

While HyDE can significantly enhance your dense retrieval system, there are some considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Customization**: Modify the LLM prompts to better fit your specific use case.
2. **Multiple Answer Generations**: Generate multiple hypothetical answers to increase the robustness of the embeddings.
3. **Limitation Scope**: Avoid using HyDE for topics outside the LLM's knowledge scope to prevent hallucinations.
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Use domain-specific prompts to guide the LLM accurately.

## Conclusion

HyDE, or Hypothetical Document Embeddings, is a powerful technique for enhancing dense retrieval systems. By leveraging large language models to generate hypothetical answers, we can significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of our search results. This approach has practical implications for various domains, including customer support, information retrieval, and search engines.
